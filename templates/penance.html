    <p class="Mainbodytext">Also known as Confession or Penance, the sacrament of Reconciliation is seen as an opportunity for renewal and can be done as often as needed.
       Reconciliation is a way of obtaining forgiveness from God for sins that we are truly remorseful for. It brings the sinner back into communion with God and the Church.
       It is important to receive this sacrament because it is an opportunity to reflect on yourself and your actions and it requires the person to take full responsibility for his or her sins,
       both in thought and action. It is important as Catholics to examine ourselves every so often and do a good examination of our conscience to make sure we are living out our life according to how Christ lived.
       Reconciliation can be performed multiple times after you reach the age of discretion, often 7 years old.
       After someone reaches this age, they are obliged to confess faithfully his or her grave sins at least once a year.
       At least in modern times, the sacrament of reconciliation is often performed before the sacrament of the first communion.
       Confession in the eyes of the church is a very important sacrament. To the Church, having someone repent for their sins and ask God for forgiveness is exactly what God wants. Not only is it good for you but
       it is also good for your relationship with God and trying to be closer to him.
